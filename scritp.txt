Intro-intro:
Hello
I’m Michael Barr
An attourney at the 
(um)
Cowell firm

Introduction:
When Nicholas first told me that he was running for mayor
Well I’d be darned if I didn’t say I was
Skeptical 
At first
 
I never thought that he 
would be where he is 
Today

Body:
Whenever Nicholas walks into the office
Greats everybody with a smile

He has a projection
Of confidence

Not just in him
But in others

From humble beginnings
Coming here to LA at the age of twelve

Immediately admitted to Harvard Westlake, one of the most prestigious high schools 
in the world
And joining a baseball team

He attended UCLA 

And through the years
He advanced
Academically
Physically *chuckle*
Intellectually

The result is profound

Although he may be a bit humble at times
Don’t let him fool you 

Conclusion:
He has a deep sympathy
For the people of Los Angeles

And for the time I’ve worked with him
He has been a great friend

I know Nicholas will make the world
A better place
