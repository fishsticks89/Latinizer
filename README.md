A macron keyboard for Latin students (work in progress)

This can also be used as a template for other types of keyboards! just modify the arrays in *macronizer.js,* and delete unnecessary code! (not reccomended until Latinizer has a stable release)

**Note:** I apologize for any mispellings of the word *character* throughout the codebase.

# What Latinizer Does

While Latinizer is, first and foremost, a macron keyboard, it also has a few other functions:

Noun/Verb endings:
Latinizer provides an easy interface for searching for endings (verb endings not yet implemented)

Dictionary:
Latinizer has integration with Whitaker's words for easy dictionary use
